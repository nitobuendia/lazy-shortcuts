## Data Collection

Lazy Shorcuts does not collect any data, with the exception of the mapping
between the short URLs and long URLs. However, no data (including this mapping)
ever leaves your browser to any server. The only interaction with any server
is when you are redirected to the requested long URL. For the landing website,
this is just the same as if you had typed the website address or clicked on a
bookmark.

Since no data is collected, no data is used, transferred or sold to any first
or third parties either.

## Permissions

Lazy Shorcuts uses the following browser functionality (permissions):

*   `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` is used to read the URL you have
    typed, see whether it matches one of the short URLs and, if so, modify the
    HTTP request to redirect you to the long URL instead.

*   `host` permissions is used to read the URL you have typed and see whether
    it matches one of the short URLs. Host permission is used to enable
    shortcuts like `m/` and `c/` which are its own different hosts, instead of
    restricting to one specific domain only.

All the URL processing is done within the browser and no data is collected,
used or shared with any server or parties. No contents other than the URL are
ever checked.
